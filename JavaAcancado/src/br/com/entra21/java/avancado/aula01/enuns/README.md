# Learning about ENUM

## ENUM
- The Java enum is a data type used to store a set of constant values, that is, they are fixed values, which cannot be modified. In practice, the enum is a special kind of class that uses the enum keyword when declared.
- The items of an enum are separated by commas, and must be declared with capital letter. It is worth mentioning that the word enum represents the abbreviation of enumerations, or enumerations, in Portuguese.
- The enum is a powerful feature of the Java language that provides several benefits to the application and to the programmer, as it helps to make the code cleaner, reusable, easier to understand and to perform maintenance. And that's not all: it contains a series of inherited methods and allows you to create your own attributes and methods to add even more functionality to the application.
