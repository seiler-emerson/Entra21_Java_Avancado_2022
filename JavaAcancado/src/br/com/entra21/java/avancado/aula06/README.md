# Learning about Generics

Generics is a way of preparing declarations where the type will be dynamic.
A good example for this is when we create interfaces that have the purpose of determining which behaviors and each class has the responsibility to implement in its own way.
When the declarations in the interface don't involve specific parameters or returns, that's fine, but when they do, it's necessary to use generics otherwise the classes that implement the interface wouldn't have gained any
