# Learning about HashMap

A special collection that has usage rules
It is a double list with unique keys and for each key a value
It does not allow duplicates, as it uses key and value, so when there is a duplicate entry, the record will be updated.
When scrolling through the items, it is possible to notice that the order does not obey the insertion or alphabetical criteria.
The order is defined by the collection by its algorithm's own criteria.

## Examples 

<img src="./img/example_01.png" alt="Example 01" width="900px">
