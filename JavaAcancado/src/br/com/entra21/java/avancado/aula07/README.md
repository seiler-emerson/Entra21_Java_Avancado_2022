# Learning about Exceptions

Exceptions occur when something unforeseen happens, they can come from logic errors or access to resources that might not be available.
Some possible logic errors for an exception to occur are:
- Trying to manipulate an object that has a null value.
- Divide a number by zero.
- Trying to manipulate one data type as if it were another.
- Trying to use a non-existent method or class.
