# Learning about Datas and Annotations

## Datas
- As of Java 8, there is a new data API available in the java.time package. This API is an excellent addition to the standard Java libraries and has been in development since 2007.
- One of the main concepts of this new API is the separation of how temporal data is interpreted into two categories: that of computers and that of humans.

## Examples 

<img src="./img/example_01.png" alt="Example 01" width="900px">
<!-- ![Example Main](./img/example_01.png) -->

## Annotations
- To define an annotation in Java code, we use the at sign (@) followed by its name. Depending on the annotation category, you may need to add data to it, in the form of name=value pairs.
- There are three categories of annotations:
    - Marker annotations
    - Single value annotations
    - Complete notes

## Examples 

<img src="./img/example_02.png" alt="Example 02" width="900px">
<img src="./img/example_03.png" alt="Example 03" width="900px">
<img src="./img/example_04.png" alt="Example 04" width="900px">
<!-- ![Example Main](./img/example_02.png) -->
<!-- ![Example Main](./img/example_03.png) -->
<!-- ![Example Main](./img/example_04.png) -->
